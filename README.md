# NumberGuesserGui
this is my first project, it's a random number generator that gives the user an opportunity to guess the number.

the code generates a random number then allows the user to guess by inputing a number and submitting it.

if the number is greater, a relevant response is given to the user to notify them of this, vice versa with a number less than the randomly generated number.

if the number guessed is correct, the gui notifies the user that the guess is correct, and asks them whether they would like to close the program or start a new game
